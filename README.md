# Chirper - Basic Social Media Web Application

Chirper is a modern social media web application built with Laravel, designed to provide users with a Twitter-like experience. Users can post, edit, and delete tweets, interact with others, and receive real-time updates, all while staying informed with email notifications.

Built using Laravelâ€™s features such as event handling, broadcasting, and email notifications, Chirper is a scalable platform for social interaction. With a clean and responsive UI, Chirper delivers a seamless experience for users to engage in conversations, post thoughts, and manage their profiles.

Note: The web app only focuses on the core functionality of this web app therefore some pages are simple
